# Sample Project

This project uses ATLASKIT for componentization (well, mostly) and Foundation's XY-Grid. And its a partnership between Prefacio Editora, Mirai Midia, Fortes Web.

Sorry for the poor design, to date we still did not receive their UX-Designer's graphic identity guide or the mockups for constructing the interface.

## Running
* First of all, edit the config file: src/constants/config.js as you see fit.
* Then run "yarn install" (for installing dependencies)
* After just run "Yarn start"
